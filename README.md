# `Auto Junkies`

Auto Junkies is a subdivision of HoodRats Forum. Its primary purpose is to allow Users to post help adds and connect with Providers on a client and provider level so that they may arrange diagnosis and repairs outide of the Forum network.

## Structure

---

- Home page lists options to sign in as User or Provider.
- Home page is just that. On the top of the page you will see a nav bar which will allow you to navigate through the different pages that the site has to offer... but be aware, you will need to sign up in order to navigate past the sign in page

---

### User Model

---

- Once logged in, Users will be able to navigate through their profile and edit their information. Users will also be able to create adds on a separate tab.

---

### Provider Model

---

- Once logged in, Providers will be able to review Users posts so that they may express interest in their capability of completing the job in which the User posted. The Provider will not have access to view other providers, only users posts. Once the provider deems they are confident of the repair, they may express interest by "commenting" on the add which will allow the user to get into contact with them.

### Models - Users

- ```js
  "use strict";
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt");
const { Model } = require("sequelize");
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  class User extends Model {
    /**
     * Helper method for defining associations.
     * This method is not a part of Sequelize lifecycle.
     * The `models/index` file will call this method automatically.
     */
    static associate(models) {
      models.User.hasMany(models.Advertisement, { foreignKey: "userId" });
      models.User.hasMany(models.Comment, { foreignKey: "userId" });
    }
  }
  User.init(
    {
      name: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        validate: {
          len: {
            args: [1, 99],
            msg: "Name must be between 1 and 99 characters",
          },
        },
      },
      provider: {
        type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN,
        defaultValue: false,
      },
      providerNumber: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
      },
      email: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        validate: {
          isEmail: {
            msg: "Invalid email",
          },
        },
      },
      password: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        validate: {
          len: {
            args: [8, 99],
            msg: "Password must be between 8 and 99 characters",
          },
        },
      },
    },
    {
      sequelize,
      modelName: "User",
    }
  );
  // Before a user is created, we are encrypting the password and using hash in its place
  User.addHook("beforeCreate", (pendingUser) => {
    // pendingUser is user object that gets passed to DB
    // Bcrypt is going to hash the password
    let hash = bcrypt.hashSync(pendingUser.password, 12); // hash 12 times
    pendingUser.password = hash; // this will go to the DB
  });
  // Check the password on Sign-In and compare it to the hashed password in the DB
  User.prototype.validPassword = function (typedPassword) {
    let isCorrectPassword = bcrypt.compareSync(typedPassword, this.password); // check to see if password is correct.

    return isCorrectPassword;
  };
  // return an object from the database of the user without the encrypted password
  User.prototype.toJSON = function () {
    let userData = this.get();
    delete userData.password; // it doesn't delete password from database, only removes it from this object

    return userData;
  };

  return User; // add functions above
};
  ```

### Blockers

---

- Getting both profiles separated was hard... One main thing that was fighting me in the beginning was using passport. Passport would not recognize the provider so I separated both like below...

```js
//Provider//
providerRouter.post(
  "/login",
  passport.authenticate("provider-local", {
    successRedirect: "/",
    failureRedirect: "/provider/login",
    successFlash: "Welcome back ...",
    failureFlash: true,
  })
);

//User//
userRouter.post(
  "/login",
  passport.authenticate("user-local", {
    successRedirect: "/",
    failureRedirect: "/user/login",
    successFlash: "Welcome back ...",
    failureFlash: true,
  })
);
```

THEN, this didnt work, so I reverted back and made the provider and user the same model, with added conditions like below:

```js
provider: {
        type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN,
        defaultValue: false,
      },
      providerNumber: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
      },
```
